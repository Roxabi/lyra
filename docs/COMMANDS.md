## The `lyra` CLI

The `lyra` CLI is the main entry point for managing Lyra from your shell. It replaces the former `python -m lyra` and `lyra-agent` commands.

### Installation

After `uv sync`, activate the virtual environment to put `lyra` on your PATH:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
# Or add .venv/bin to your PATH permanently in ~/.bashrc:
# export PATH="$HOME/projects/lyra/.venv/bin:$PATH"
```

### Subcommands

**Server**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lyra` / `lyra start` | Start the Lyra server |
| `lyra --version` / `lyra -V` | Print the installed version |
| `lyra --help` | List all available subcommands |

**Agent management**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lyra agent create <name>` | Scaffold a new agent TOML |
| `lyra agent list` | List all discovered agents |
| `lyra agent validate [<name>]` | Validate agent TOML config(s) |

**Config management**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lyra config show` | Print the resolved `config.toml` |
| `lyra config validate` | Validate `config.toml` against the schema |

> `lyra-agent` still works but prints a deprecation warning. Migrate to `lyra agent <subcommand>`.

### Agent config directories

Lyra searches for agent TOML files in two locations, in order of precedence:

1. `~/.lyra/agents/` — user-level configs (take precedence)
2. `src/lyra/agents/` — project-level configs (bundled defaults)

If the same agent name exists in both directories, the user-level file wins.

### Machine-wide defaults (`config.toml [defaults]`)

The `[defaults]` section in `config.toml` lets you set machine-wide fallbacks for `cwd`, `persona`, and `workspaces` that apply to all agents unless overridden in the agent's own TOML:

```toml
[defaults]
cwd = "~/projects/lyra"

[defaults.workspaces]
lyra     = "~/projects/lyra"
projects = "~/projects"
```

## Overview

Lyra intercepts messages starting with `/` or `!` before they reach the LLM agent. Commands are routed to built-in handlers or plugins — fast, deterministic, zero token cost.

```
User → /echo hi  → Telegram → Hub → CommandRouter → builtin   → Response → Telegram → User
User → hello     → Telegram → Hub → (not a command) → Agent (LLM) → Response → Telegram → User
User → !unknown  → Telegram → Hub → CommandRouter → no handler → Agent (LLM) → Response → Telegram → User
```

### The two prefixes: `/` vs `!`

| Prefix | Known command | Unknown command |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| `/`    | Dispatched to handler | Returns "Unknown command" error |
| `!`    | Dispatched to handler | **Falls through to LLM** |

`!` is a "soft command" prefix. Use it when you want command-like syntax but are OK with the LLM receiving it if no handler matches. It is not a separate command system — it shares the same registry. Only the error behavior differs.

### Platform-native command menus

Lyra does **not** register commands with Telegram's `setMyCommands()` or Discord's `app_commands` tree. All command handling is application-level text parsing. This means:

- No autocomplete menu appears in either platform's native UI
- The same command set works identically across Telegram and Discord
- Plugins hot-reload without resyncing a Discord command tree

To add native Telegram autocomplete, call `bot.set_my_commands([BotCommand(...)])` at startup — it's cosmetic only, the routing stays the same.

### Full routing order

```
Incoming message
  │
  ├─ Adapter pre-routing (Discord only)
  │    └─ !join / !leave → voice channel join/leave (guild-only, before mention filter)
  │
  ├─ CommandParser: detect / or ! prefix → CommandContext
  │
  ├─ CommandRouter.dispatch():
  │    1. Bare URL? → rewrite to /add <url>
  │    2. Builtin?  → /help, /clear, /new, /stop, /config, /circuit, /routing, /folder, /cd
  │    3. Workspace? → /<key> from agent TOML [workspaces]
  │    4. Session?  → /add, /explain, /summarize, /search (isolated LLM calls)
  │    5. Plugin?   → any [[commands]] from enabled plugin.toml files
  │    6. Passthrough? → registered commands that skip dispatch, go to LLM (e.g. /voice)
  │    7. ! prefix + unknown → return None → fall through to LLM
  │    8. / prefix + unknown → return "Unknown command" error
  │
  └─ _submit_to_pool() → LLM agent (if no command matched, or fallthrough)
```

### Where should a new command go?

| Scenario | Layer |
|----------|-------|
| Affects session/bot state (clear history, change workspace) | Hub builtin |
| Isolated LLM task that must not pollute chat history | Session command |
| Feature that can be toggled per-agent | Plugin |
| Needs LLM reasoning but user wants `/`-like entry syntax | Passthrough (register in `agent.py`) |
| Discord voice channel control (guild-only, stateful) | Adapter-level pre-routing |
| Everything else | Plain text → LLM |

---

## Session Commands

Session commands (`/add`, `/explain`, `/summarize`) make an isolated LLM call per invocation. They never read or write the pool conversation history — they are stateless with respect to the active session.

### `/add <url>` — Save to vault

```
/add https://example.com/article
```

Pipeline: **scrape** (`web-intel:scrape`) → **LLM summary** (title, paragraph summary, 3-5 tags) → **vault write** (`vault add`).

Returns the title + summary. If scraping or vault CLI is unavailable, still returns the summary with a note.

### `/explain <url>` — Plain-language explanation

```
/explain https://example.com/paper
```

Pipeline: **scrape** → **LLM explanation** (plain language, suitable for chat). No vault write.

### `/summarize <url>` — Bullet-point summary

```
/summarize https://example.com/doc
```

Pipeline: **scrape** → **LLM 3-5 bullet points**. No vault write.

### Bare URL auto-rewrite

Sending a bare URL (no slash command prefix) is automatically rewritten to `/add <url>`:

```
https://example.com/article   →   /add https://example.com/article
```

The detection uses `CommandRouter._BARE_URL_RE` (`^https?://\S+$`).

### `/search <query>` — Vault full-text search

```
/search asyncio event loop
```

Runs `vault search <query>` and returns matching results. Stateless — no LLM call.

### CLI dependencies

| Command | Requires | Graceful fallback |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| `/add` | `web-intel:scrape`, `vault` | LLM runs on URL string if scrape fails; vault error noted in response |
| `/explain` | `web-intel:scrape` | Explanation runs on URL string if scrape unavailable |
| `/summarize` | `web-intel:scrape` | Summary runs on URL string if scrape unavailable |
| `/search` | `vault` | Returns `"vault CLI not available."` — not fatal |

### How it works internally

Session commands use `SessionCommandHandler` protocol (defined in `CommandRouter`) and are registered in `CommandRouter._session_commands`. The `AnthropicAgent` passes its LLM driver to the handler — LLM calls use an isolated `pool_id` (`"session:<command>"`) that never touches the real pool history.

```python
class SessionCommandHandler(Protocol):
    async def __call__(
        self, msg: InboundMessage, driver: LlmProvider, args: list[str], timeout: float
    ) -> Response: ...
```

---

## Workspace Commands

Workspaces are named directory shortcuts defined in the agent TOML under `[workspaces]`. Each key becomes a `/keyname` slash command that sets the working directory for the Claude subprocess in that conversation scope.

### Configuration

```toml
# src/lyra/agents/lyra_default.toml

[model]
cwd = "~/projects/lyra"   # optional: fixed default cwd for this agent

[workspaces]
lyra        = "~/projects/lyra"
projects    = "~/projects"
roxabi-vault = "~/.roxabi-vault"
```

### Usage

```
Syntax: /<workspace>
        /<workspace> <question>
```

- `/lyra` — sets the workspace to `~/projects/lyra`, responds with a context confirmation
- `/lyra what's the last commit?` — sets the workspace, then forwards the question to Claude with `cwd=~/projects/lyra`

The cwd override persists for the pool (thread/conversation) lifetime. `/clear` respawns the process but keeps the same workspace. Use another workspace command to switch.

In Discord with `auto_thread=True`: each thread has its own pool, so workspace commands are per-thread. Multiple threads can have different workspaces in parallel.

## UX Examples

### `/help` — Discover commands

```
You:  /help
Lyra: Available commands:
      /help    — List available commands
      /stop    — Cancel the current processing turn
      /clear   — Clear conversation history
      /new     — Start a new session (alias for /clear)
      /echo    — Echo back the message (test command)
      /voice   — Generate speech ⚠ requires voicecli

      Type any command or just chat normally.
```

### `/clear` / `/new` — Reset session

```
You:  /clear
Lyra: Conversation history cleared.
```

### Normal chat (unchanged)

```
You:  What's the weather in Paris?
Lyra: Currently in Paris it's 12°C and partly cloudy...
```

No interception — goes through the normal LLM agent flow.

---

## Error Handling

### CLI not installed

```
You:  /voice Hello world
Lyra: ⚠ Command unavailable: `voicecli` is not installed.
      Install: see setup.sh or run `uv tool install voicecli`
```

### Unknown command

```
You:  /pizza
Lyra: Unknown command: /pizza
      Type /help for available commands.
```

### Timeout

```
You:  /voice Generate a long podcast intro
Lyra: ⚠ Command timed out.
      Try a shorter request or run manually.
```

> Timeout depends on LLM response time plus TTS synthesis duration — there is no fixed limit.

---

## How It Works

### End-to-End Flow: `/echo hello`

```
1. USER types "/echo hello" in Telegram

2. TELEGRAM ADAPTER
   ├── Parses update → text="/echo hello", chat_id, user_id
   ├── Creates Message(content=TextContent(text="/echo hello"))
   └── Pushes to hub.inbound_bus (per-platform Queue)

3. HUB RUN LOOP
   ├── Pulls message from bus
   ├── Rate limit check → OK
   ├── Resolves binding → agent="lyra_default"
   │
   ├── agent.command_router.is_command(msg) → True
   │
   ├── agent.command_router.dispatch(msg)
   │   ├── Parses: command="/echo", args=["hello"]
   │   ├── Plugin: "/echo" → cmd_echo handler
   │   └── Returns Response("hello")
   │
   └── dispatch_response → Telegram adapter → user sees reply

4. LLM agent is NEVER called — zero tokens, fast response
```

---

## Configuration

Built-in commands are declared in `CommandRouter._DEFAULT_BUILTINS`. Plugin commands are declared in each plugin's `plugin.toml`:

```toml
# src/lyra/plugins/echo/plugin.toml

[[commands]]
name = "echo"
description = "Echo back the message (test command)"
handler = "cmd_echo"
```

Plugins are enabled per-agent in the agent TOML config:

```toml
# src/lyra/agents/lyra_default.toml

[plugins]
enabled = ["echo"]
```

### Adding a new plugin command

A plugin command is defined across 2 layers:

**Layer 1 — `plugin.toml`** (declares the command)
```toml
[[commands]]
name = "mycmd"
description = "My command"   # shown in /help
handler = "cmd_mycmd"
```

**Layer 2 — `handlers.py`** (implements the handler)
```python
async def cmd_mycmd(args: list[str], msg: InboundMessage) -> Response:
    return Response(content=f"You said: {' '.join(args)}")
```

**That's it.** Enable the plugin in the agent TOML and the command appears in `/help` immediately (hot-reload).

### Full chain

```
1. plugin.toml declares [[commands]] name = "mycmd"
2. Agent hot-reloads → /mycmd appears in /help
3. User types "/mycmd foo bar" in Telegram (or Discord)
4. CommandRouter:
   ├── Parses: command="/mycmd", args=["foo", "bar"]
   ├── Plugin registry: "/mycmd" → cmd_mycmd handler
   ├── Calls: await cmd_mycmd(["foo", "bar"], msg)
   └── Returns response to user
5. User sees result — no LLM involved
```

## Architecture

```
Built-in commands          Plugin commands             CLI-backed commands        Session commands (LLM)
───────────────────        ────────────────────        ─────────────────────      ──────────────────────
/help   → _help()          /echo  → cmd_echo()         /voice → voicecli          /add     → cmd_add()
/stop   → pool.cancel()    /invite → cmd_invite()                                 /explain → cmd_explain()
/clear  → _cmd_clear()     /join   → cmd_join()                                   /summarize→cmd_summarize()
/config → _cmd_config()    /svc    → cmd_svc()                                    /search  → cmd_search()
                           /search → cmd_search()
```

Two access paths for voice:
1. **`/voice` command** (user types `/voice <text>`) → registered as passthrough in CommandRouter → rewritten with `modality="voice"` → pool/agent → LLM generates reply → TTS synthesizes to OGG/Opus → sent as native voice message (`IS_VOICE_MESSAGE` on Discord, `send_voice` on Telegram). `Response.speak=True` signals the hub to trigger TTS. It is NOT a direct CLI subprocess.
2. **Agent with Bash tool** (user asks "say hello") → LLM decides to call voicecli directly
